## Application Information
The application can be accessed via this link: https://andrewcmonson.github.io/server-side-api-challenge/

## Application Status
Due to time constraints, this application is incomplete. It will pull weather from any city you suggest, but it cannot return you to your searched cities. This functionality may or may not be added in the future.
